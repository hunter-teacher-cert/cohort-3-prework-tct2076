4.11 Exercise 1
1. When "baffle" is called it prints "wug" and then calls "ping".
   When "ping" is called it prints "." then creates a newline.

  The output of this program is as follows:
    No, I wug.
    You wugga wug.
    I wug.

    First, main prints "No, I " with a space after I. Then, zoop is called invoking baffle, which prints "wug". Next, ping is invoked, which prints "." 

    Since println is used, it creates a new line, "You wugga " with a space after wugga, baffle is invoked, which prints "wug", and ping is invoked, which prints "." 

    A new is created, main prints "I " followed by a space, baffle is invoked, which prints "wug", ping is invoked, which prints ".".

  2. Stack diagram as follows:
    main
      zoop
        baffle
          ping
        baffle
          ping
      baffle

3. If you invoke baffle(); at the end of the ping method, this would continue endlessly because it call itself continuously.
